# 📋 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR COURSE PAGES

## How to Generate SEO Elements Dynamically

### Option 1: Database-Driven (Recommended)
Store course metadata in the database with SEO fields:

```javascript
// Backend - Course Model Enhancement
const courseSchema = {
  // ... existing fields
  seoSlug: String,               // Unique URL slug
  seoTitle: String,              // 50-60 chars
  seoDescription: String,        // 140-160 chars
  seoKeywords: [String],         // Array of keywords
  seoPrimaryKeyword: String,     // Main keyword
  h1Heading: String,             // H1 for page
  courseOutcomes: [String],      // Learning outcomes
  targetAudience: String,        // Who should take this
};

// SEO Migration Query
db.courses.updateMany({}, {
  $set: {
    seoSlug: function(title) {
      return title.toLowerCase()
        .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')
        .replace(/(^-|-$)/g, '');
    }
  }
});
```

### Option 2: Auto-Generate in Frontend
```typescript
// frontend/lib/seo/courseMetadata.ts
import { generateCourseMetadata } from '@/lib/seo/metadata';

export async function generateCoursePageMetadata(courseId: string) {
  const course = await fetchCourse(courseId);
  
  const slug = course.title
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')
    .replace(/(^-|-$)/g, '');
  
  const keywords = generateKeywords(course);
  
  return generateCourseMetadata({
    title: course.title,
    description: course.description,
    keywords,
    slug,
    category: course.category,
    level: course.level,
    price: course.price,
    rating: course.rating,
  });
}
```

### Option 3: Use This Reference Document
Manually update each course's layout.tsx with elements from this document:

```typescript
// frontend/app/courses/[id]/layout.tsx
import { COURSE_SEO_ELEMENTS } from '@/lib/seo/courseElements';

export const metadata = COURSE_SEO_ELEMENTS['react-complete-guide'];
```
